        # The Secret to Reading Russian
        Russian looks scary, but many letters are the same as English!
        
        - **A** is "A"
        - **K** is "K"
        - **M** is "M"
        - **O** is "O"
        - **T** is "T"
        
        Let's read some words that are exactly the same in both languages.

      - word: "Мама"
