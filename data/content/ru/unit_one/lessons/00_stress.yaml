        title: "Russian Has Unpredictable Stress"
        content: |
          Unlike English (where stress follows patterns) or Spanish (where rules exist),
          Russian stress is **completely unpredictable**. Every word must be memorized!
          
          The good news: we mark stress for you with an accent mark (◌́).
          The challenge: incorrect stress can change meaning or sound very foreign.

          **Stress changes meaning!**
          - за́мок = castle
          - замо́к = lock
          
          Same letters, different stress = different word!

        title: "What Happens to Unstressed Vowels"
        content: |
          Stressed vowels are pronounced clearly. Unstressed vowels get **reduced**:
          
          - Unstressed **О** sounds like **А** (short, unclear)
          - Unstressed **Е** sounds like **И** (reduced)
          - Unstressed **Я** sounds like **И** (reduced)
          
          This is called **vowel reduction** and it's a huge part of the Russian accent!

          - ["вода", "вода́", "va-DA", "water"]
          - ["она", "она́", "a-NA", "she"]
          - ["спасибо", "спаси́бо", "spa-SI-ba", "thanks"]
      
      - type: "tip"
        content: |
          **The pattern**: In молоко́ (milk), both О's before the stress sound like 'a'!
          Write: молоко → Hear: malakó
          
          This is why stress marks are critical for learners.

        title: "Some Helpful Patterns"
        content: |
          While stress is unpredictable overall, some patterns can help:
          
          **Always stressed:**
          - **Ё** (yo) is ALWAYS stressed: живёт, идёт, моё
          - No accent mark needed - if you see Ё, that's the stress!
          
          **Common endings:**
          - Verbs in **-а́ть**: понима́ть, чита́ть, де́лать (varies!)
          - Adjectives often stress the **ending**: большо́й, молодо́й
          - **-ция** words: stress before -ция: ста́нция, ле́кция
      
      - type: "morphology_pattern"
        title: "Stress Can Move!"
        formula: "Infinitive → Conjugation stress may shift"
        examples:
          - { ru: "писа́ть → пишу́", en: "to write → I write (stress moves!)" }
          - { ru: "хоте́ть → хочу́ → хо́чешь", en: "to want → I want → you want (moves again!)" }
          - { ru: "понима́ть → понима́ю", en: "to understand → I understand (stays)" }
        rule: |
          Verbs are tricky! The stress can move between infinitive and conjugated forms.
          That's why we mark stress on ALL conjugation forms.

      - type: "explanation"
        title: "How We Mark Stress"
        content: |
          Throughout this course, we use the **acute accent** (◌́) to show stress:
          
          - понима́ть (stress on third syllable)
          - рабо́тать (stress on second syllable)
          - телефо́н (stress on last syllable)
          
          **In real Russian text, stress is NOT marked!**
          That's why learning it now is critical - you won't see these marks in the wild.
      
      - type: "tip"
        content: |
          **Practice tip**: When learning a new word, ALWAYS say it with correct stress.
          Wrong stress is a hard habit to break later!
          
          Audio files in this course use native speakers - match their stress.

        points:
          - "Russian stress is unpredictable - memorize it with each word"
          - "Stressed vowels are clear; unstressed О sounds like А"
          - "Ё is always stressed - no mark needed"
          - "Stress can change meaning (за́мок ≠ замо́к)"
          - "We mark stress with ◌́ - use it to learn correctly"
          - "In verb conjugations, stress can move - check each form"
