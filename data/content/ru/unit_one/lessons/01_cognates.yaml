        content: |
          Many Russian letters look AND sound like English!
          With just 5 letters, you'll read real Russian words.
          
          No memorization needed - these letters work the same way.

          - ["О", "o", "O in 'for'"]

          - { word: "mère", lang: "French", relation: "cousin" }
          - { word: "Mama", lang: "German", relation: "cognate" }
        insight: "The word for 'mother' is nearly universal across languages - one of humanity's first words!"

    title: "Location Patterns"
    type: "pattern"
    
    teaching:
      - type: "morphology_pattern"
        title: "The Location Pattern"
        formula: "{NOUN} + {тут/там} = Where something is"
        examples:
          - { ru: "Кот тут.", en: "The cat is here." }
          - { ru: "Мама там.", en: "Mom is there." }
          - { ru: "Такси тут.", en: "The taxi is here." }
        rule: "Russian doesn't need 'is' - just noun + location word!"
      
      - type: "etymology"
        title: "тут vs там"
        word: "тут/там"
        connections:
          - { word: "here/there", lang: "English", relation: "cognate" }
        insight: |
          тут (here) and там (there) form a pair, like English here/there.
          Notice how they both start with Т - this isn't coincidence!
