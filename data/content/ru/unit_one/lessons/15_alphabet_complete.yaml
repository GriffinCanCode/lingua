        content: |
          You've learned 26 letters! These final vowels have sounds 
          that don't have exact English equivalents - but you'll pick them up fast.

          **Ы is the hardest Russian sound for English speakers!**
          Try saying "ee" but pull your tongue back and down.
          
          Don't stress - Russians will understand you even if it's not perfect!

          Ё is **ALWAYS** stressed - no accent mark needed!

          - её = ye-YO (her)
          - моё = ma-YO (my, neuter)

        content: |
          **Soft sign Ь doesn't make a sound!**
          It tells you to "soften" the consonant before it.
          
          - мат = "mat" (checkmate)
          - мать = "mat'" (mother) - the Т is softened

          **Don't panic about cursive yet!**
          Most text you'll see is printed/typed.
          
          When writing by hand, printing is perfectly acceptable!
          Focus on reading first, cursive later.
