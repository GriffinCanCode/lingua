        title: "Words That Change"
        content: |
          In Russian, noun endings change based on their role in the sentence.
          
          The cat sleeps. → Кот спит.
          I see the cat. → Я вижу кота.
          
          See how 'кот' became 'кота'? That's a case change!

        title: "The Basic Form"
        content: |
          Nominative is the dictionary form - what you've been learning!
          It's used for the subject (the one doing the action).
          
          Кот спит. (The cat sleeps.)
          Мама тут. (Mom is here.)
      
      - type: "morphology_pattern"
        title: "Nominative = Subject"
        formula: "{SUBJECT (nominative)} + verb"
        examples:
          - { ru: "Кот там.", en: "The cat is there." }
          - { ru: "Собака тут.", en: "The dog is here." }
          - { ru: "Это мама.", en: "This is mom." }
        rule: "If the noun is doing something or being described, use nominative (no change!)."

        title: "The Object"
        content: |
          Accusative is for the object - what receives the action.
          
          For masculine animate nouns, add -а:
          Я вижу кота. (I see the cat.)
          
          For feminine nouns, change -а to -у:
          Я вижу маму. (I see mom.)
